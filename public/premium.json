        "description": "It was the World Cup final, with 1.5 billion watching around the world but no one could claim they saw it coming. Argentina had been 2-0 for 44 minutes. France hadn’t even found a shot on target until then. They had been made to look ordinary all through the first half in the face of a relentless Argentine onslaught. Their talismanic goal scorer, Kylian Mbappe had only 11 touches of the ball in the first half. The odds couldn’t have been more stacked up. Suddenly, something sensational unfolded.A momentary lapse of concentration from Argentina and France had a penalty. A skip, hop, and a pause later, Mbappe struck it ruthlessly past Emiliano Martinez, who could only get his fingertips on the ball that whizzed past and rolled into the net. The prodigious scorer smelled blood. Perhaps only he did.."

        "description": "In the court’s view, the aforementioned facts and circumstances are sufficient to conclude that at least some of the rights claimed by South Africa and for which it is seeking protection are plausible,” said the ruling read in court Friday by Joan Donoghue, an American who is one of 17 judges considering the case. “This is the case with respect to the right of Palestinians in Gaza to be protected from acts of genocide and related prohibited acts.Israel must report back to the court in a month, based on which the court will decide whether to issue a final ruling in the case. But Friday’s ruling was a milestone in the case, which opponents of Israel hope will provide an imprimatur to their claims that Israel is committing war crimes. Israel contested the case in part because it was founded in the wake of the Holocaust and rejects that its war against Hamas meets the definition of a genocide."
