As a testament to the shared desire of people and governments around the world to advance lasting peace, prosperity, and human dignity, the United States is pleased to join over 70 governments and authorities in endorsing the Summit for Democracy Declaration.The Declaration was developed and negotiated by an intergovernmental coordination body that included participation from over 65 governments and authorities from Africa, Asia, Europe, North America, and South America. To allow all Summit for Democracy participating governments and authorities the opportunity to endorse the text, the Declaration will remain open for endorsement following the conclusion of the second Summit."

      "description": "Tech News Today in India: Samsung’s upcoming wearable – the Galaxy Ring will reportedly come in various sizes and have three different material finishes. The next version of Google’s smartwatch – the Pixel Watch 3 might come in two different sizes. Apple might have sold somewhere around 1,60,000 to 1,80,000 units of the Vision Pro. The news comes from the known Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, who said that the demand for the product is still strong, but will decline once early adopters get their hands on the device. In a blog post on Medium, he also claimed that Apple might ship around 5,00,000 Vision Pro units by the end of the year."

I tried everything I possibly can in the very short amount of time in the changeovers, Djokovic said after the clash at Rod Laver Arena, which stretched to three hours and 45 minutes.But, you know, I think we both felt the effect of the heat. When you're playing on a hard court, the heat is absorbed in the surface. So down there for us players, we feel probably even more heat than you would feel in the stands."
